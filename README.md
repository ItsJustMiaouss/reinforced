## ðŸ”¨ Reinforced

This mod adds reinforced blocks like the [SecurityCraft](https://github.com/Geforce132/SecurityCraft) ones. These blocks can only be broken by the player who own them.

The reinforced blocks are not sensible to the wither, ender dragon, explosions and pistons. They also occult the sculk signals like a wool block.

> This mod is currently being developped. Breaks may occur.
